# Star Wars SWAPI App - React

Simple app to pull data from a Star Wars API and display all currently added characters within the Star Wars universe. The app displays the characters and colors the background based on their species. Up hover, you can view more details or click through to see even more information in a modal.

**TESTING**

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install the correct node modules.
3. Run `npm start` in your terminal to view the files locally in development.
4. Once the site loads the data, you can scroll down to find all characters
   - Hover over the character you want to see more information about to see a quick snippet of their information.
   - Click the character to see a modal with additional information.
5. You can also use the search bar to filter the characters by name. As you type the filter will use the `data-name` varaible to filter all characters based on what you type.
6. You can view the completed app using other devices to verify responsiveness.
7. Close out the local server (`CMD + C` or `CTRL + C`)
